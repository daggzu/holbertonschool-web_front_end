## Introduction

HTML is the backbone of web content. It provides structure and meaning to text and multimedia elements on web pages.

## HTML Skeleton

- Create an HTML5 page structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.
- Use `<title>` within the `<head>` to set the browser tab's title.

## Semantic HTML

- Use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<aside`> to give meaning to content.
- Enhance accessibility and SEO by using these tags correctly.

## Headings

- Use `<h1>` to `<h6>` to provide hierarchy and structure to text.
- Follow a hierarchical order for accessibility and SEO.

## Lists

- Create ordered lists `<ol>` and unordered lists `<ul>` with list items `<li>`.
- For definition lists, use `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>`.

## Images

- Embed images using the `<img>` tag, specifying the `src` attribute for the image source.
- Use the `alt` attribute for accessibility and SEO.

## The `<head>` Section

- Contains metadata, stylesheets, scripts, and more.
- Includes elements like `<meta>`, `<link>`, `<title>`, and `<script>` for various purposes.
- Not visible to users but essential for SEO, accessibility, and user experience.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

- SEO is the practice of optimizing web content to improve search engine rankings.
